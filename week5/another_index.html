        <p>
          <strong> Linux Mint </strong> is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Debian
          and Ubuntu that strives to be a "modern, elegant and comfortable
          operating system which is both powerful and easy to use." Linux
          Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including
          some proprietary software and comes bundled with a variety of free and
          open-source applications; however, with the release of v18
          "Sarah" some previously included proprietary software such as
          multimedia codecs was no longer included by default. Its motto is
          <i>"from freedom came elegance."</i>

        <h3>Update Manager New Features</h3>

        <p>
          The update manager received many improvements, both visual and under
          the hood.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main screen and the preferences screen now use stack widgets and
          subtle animations, and better support was given for alternative themes
           (toolbar icons are now compatible with dark themes, application and
           status icons are now themeable and dimmed text is now rendered with
           dynamic colors). </p>

           <p> ** "apt install" and "apt remove" now show progress output.</p>
           <p> ** New commands were introduced to support Debian's syntax.</p>
           <p> ** "apt full-upgrade" does the same as "apt dist-upgrade"</p>
           <p>"apt edit-sources" the same as "apt sources" and </p>
           <p>"apt showhold" the same as "apt held".</p>

        <p>
          Two new settings were added to let you see and select kernel updates.
          Even though these arenâ€™t really updates, but the availability of
          packages for newer kernels.
