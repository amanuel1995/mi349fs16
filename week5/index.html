            Hurricane Matthew is currently a strong tropical cyclone over the
            Atlantic Ocean. It was the first Category 5 Atlantic hurricane since
            Hurricane Felix in 2007. The fourteenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth
            storm, fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the annual
            hurricane season, Matthew formed from a vigorous tropical wave that
            moved off the African coast on September 22, progressing on a westward
            track until it developed into a tropical storm while it was situated
            just to the east of the Leeward Islands on September 28. A day later,
            it became a hurricane while west of the Leeward Islands, and rapidly
            strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane.

            Four people have died in Florida from the storm.
          </p>

          <p>Officials in St. Lucie County, Florida, said two people died
            overnight when emergency officials could not get to them because of
            the storm's strong winds. One victim, a woman in her late 50s, died
            from cardiac arrest, according to St. Lucie fire department officials.
            Crews could not safely respond to her location and the woman died by
            the time crews arrived, officials said. Later in the night in St.
            Lucie County, there was a report of an unconscious 82-year-old man
            breathing with difficulty. "When it was deemed safe for emergency
            vehicles to travel it was reported to first responders that the
            patient had been taken to the hospital," according to officials.
            The man was later declared dead.
