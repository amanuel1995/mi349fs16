Short Paragraph About Style Tiles

* I don’t have that much of an experience designing and doing mock ups. I did my style tiles, I chose my colors and only those colors will be appearing on the website. I have also picked my favorite fonts and I will be using only those fonts. I will most likely stick to the style tile 2. It has the variety of colors that I would need for my website, since it will be a bunch of articles and I may need a bunch of colors. I am still thinking about style textures. That would require more of design and I’m not just equipped at this point. However, I would focus on content and simplicity to make my website look decent. I have spent about 6-10 hours on both the style tiles, but the mockup has been hard to create due to the the level of accuracy it needs and my limited skill on any image manipulating software.
