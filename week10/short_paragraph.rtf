\f0\fs24 \cf0 Short Paragraph About Style Tiles\
\
* I don\'92t have that much of an experience designing and doing mock ups. I did my style tiles, I chose my colors and only those colors will be appearing on the website. I have also picked my favorite fonts and I will be using only those fonts. I will most likely stick to the style tile 2. It has the variety of colors that I would need for my website, since it will be a bunch of articles and I may need a bunch of colors. I am still thinking about style textures. That would require more of design and I\'92m not just equipped at this point. However, I would focus on content and simplicity to make my website look decent. }
